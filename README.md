# HireMee-job-view

This is just the front end code for the job viewjob component for hiremee
<br/>

This was a project I completed in my last week of Hack Reactor. I worked with a group to build a Full Stack Web Application in 6 Days.
<br/>

HireMee is a website that helps you neatly keep track of all your job applications and their respective statuses.
<br/>

Highlights: <br/>
  1. Promise based sorting function <br/>
