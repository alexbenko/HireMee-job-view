# HireMee-job-view

This is just the front end code for the job viewjob component for hiremee
<br/>

This was a project I completed in my last week of Hack Reactor. I worked with a group to build a Full Stack Web Application in 6 Days.
<br/>

HireMee is a website that helps you neatly keep track of all your job applications and their respective statuses as well as statistics and some social media aspects.
<br/>

I worked on the dashboard that displays 4 columns; Applied, Rejected, Interviews, and Offers. Then each column displays jobs by their respective application status

Highlights: <br/>
  1. Promise based sorting function <br/>
      See sortJobInfo at: https://github.com/alexbenko/HireMee-job-view/blob/master/Jobs.jsx
  2. Promise Based form checker functions <br/>
